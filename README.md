# Enchantment Library at Home

 

## Description
**Enchantment Library at Home** is a standalone mod that adds the Enchantment Library and Library of Alexandria blocks from the mod [Apotheosis](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/apotheosis). For those not familiar with Apotheosis, these blocks allow for a simple and easy way of storing and taking enchanted books for use. Storing an enchanted book in the library saves the enchantments and levels of the enchantments. Clicking on an enchantment in the UI of the library lets you extract an enchantment, and you can extract any amount of levels of the enchantment from the library as long as you have enough stored. The intent of this mod is simply to add those two enchantment storage blocks to your game, without needing to also add all the other various features that the Apotheosis mod includes, allowing for enchantment storage quality of life.
 

## **Feature Summary:**

- Store enchantments by inserting enchanted books
- Extract enchantments from the library through the UI
- Search bar and enchantment filtering based on tools for quickly finding desired enchantments
- Simple crafting recipes for both storage tiers
- Library blocks store enchantments when broken
